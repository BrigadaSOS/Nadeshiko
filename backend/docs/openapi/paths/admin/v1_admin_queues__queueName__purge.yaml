  summary: Delete failed jobs from a queue
  description: |
    Permanently delete all failed jobs from a queue.

    **Requirements:**
    - Required Scopes: `ADD_MEDIA` (admin-level permission)

    **Use cases:**
    - Clean up old failed jobs after investigating
    - Reset a queue after fixing the underlying issue
    - Note: This does NOT re-sync the segments - use the reindex endpoint for that
