    Searches for multiple words simultaneously and aggregates results by media.

    Unlike the main search endpoint, this returns a summary of matches per media rather than individual sentence segments.

    **Use Cases**
    - Vocabulary discovery across media library
    - Finding anime/dramas that use specific words
    - Comparing word usage across different titles

    **Requirements:**
    - Required Scopes: `READ_MEDIA`
