# Welcome to the Nadeshiko Blog!

We're excited to launch our blog as a place to share updates about Nadeshiko. This platform has been designed to help Japanese learners find real-world examples from anime, live action, and audiobooks.

## What to Expect

## Our Mission

Nadeshiko was created to make Japanese language learning more engaging and contextual. By providing real sentences from authentic media, we help learners understand how Japanese is actually used in everyday situations.
